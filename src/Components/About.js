    <p>To make sure all the pages are displayed below the navigation bar and are scrollable, you can use a layout approach where the AppBar is fixed at the top of the page, and the content below it scrolls. Here's how you can achieve that:

Fix the AppBar to the top: This can be done using the position="sticky" or position="fixed" prop for the AppBar. This ensures the navigation bar remains fixed at the top while the content below it scrolls.

Add padding or margin to the content: You need to add some margin or padding at the top of your content to make sure it doesn't get hidden behind the fixed AppBar.

Ensure that the page content is scrollable: You can achieve this by setting the height of the page content to 100vh (viewport height) minus the height of the AppBar.
